The project is a console Snake Game written in C++ using methods, for loops, while loops and also swtich statements. 
The snake itself is made out of letters, more precisely "O" for the head and "o" for the tail components. 
The borders are made from the "#" character and the fruit is the letter "F".
The controls for the snake are "WASD".
The game is made classic, so if you hit the wall you will lose, but if you want to have a bigger chance to get a higher score you should consider COMMENTING the 145 and 146 lines.
This will change the game's logic by letting you go through the wall and spawning in the opposite wall you have entered.
