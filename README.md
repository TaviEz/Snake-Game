# Snake-Game
Snake game for the console. Firstly, read the README file

The project is a console Snake Game written in C++ using methods, for loops, while loops and also swtich statements. 
The snake itself is made out of letters, more precisely "O" for the head and "o" for the tail components. 
The borders are made from the "#" character and the fruit is the letter "F".
The controls for the snake are "WASD".
The game is not classic, so if you hit the wall you will not lose, but if you want to play the classic version you should consider deleting the comments on the 145 and 146 lines in the Source.cpp file. Moreover, if your head hits one of the tail components you will lose.
This will stop you going through the walls.
